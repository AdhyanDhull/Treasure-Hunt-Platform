<li>Vimukti consists of various levels of varying difficulty in the form of web pages. You are supposed to solve each level step by step and proceed to next level for which you need answer for the current level. The participant who finishes the game earliest or who reaches up to the highest level till the game is closed, will be declared as winner..</li><br>

<li>To proceed to the next level you need to solve the riddle in the current level given on the Page. </li><br>

<li>There is only one way by which you can get across levels ->Entering the answer in the text box</li><br>

<li> All answers are lowercase without any spaces. (Unless specifically mentioned) </li><br>
<li>Guessing will not help. If you have the right answer you will know for sure that you have it.</li><br>

<li>Do not share the answers on personal blogs/websites or other forums. It is quite possible that the other person may finish before you. And if found sharing the answers to other competitors he/she may be banned from the event. </li><br>

<li>No spoilers will be entertained. Posting an answer (or anything close to it) on the forum is not allowed, anyone attempting to do so will be banned from the game.</li><br>

<li>This is an event for individual and Playing in groups is not allowed. The persons attempting to do so will be disqualified from the game.</li><br>
<li>As the difficulty levels increase, so does our reluctance to give out obvious clues. In case we find many players to be stuck at certain levels, a blatant push will be provided from our end. But the later levels of the game are made in such a way that players will have to spend some time wrapping their head around the clues, rather than expect the same to be solved in a matter of minutes.
</li><br>

<li>We are open to all kind of Complaints, Suggestions and Queries. Feel free to write to me at the forum, whether I answer them or not depends only on the kind of mail, and when I answer them will depend on my Happy-ness, Lazy-ness and Busy-ness levels.</li><br>

<li>Anybody can play this game but participants having a valid college ID only are entitled for Prizes.</li><br>

<li>Moksha'14 committee will get back to Participants entitled for Prizes and/or Certificate of Appreciation after the game is declared closed.</li><br>

<li>In case of any conflict or situation of ambiguity, decision taken by the Moksha organizing committee will be final.</li><br>

<li> There is a restriction of 300 attempts per level, all submissions after 300 attempts for one level will not be checked.</li><br></ol></div>";
